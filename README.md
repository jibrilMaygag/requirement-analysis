# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on **Requirement Analysis** in software development. It provides an overview of the concept, its importance in the SDLC, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria. The goal is to give a clear understanding of how to gather, analyze, and define software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the system developed aligns with business objectives and user needs.  

During requirement analysis, developers and analysts work closely with stakeholders to:  
- Understand what the system should do  
- Identify constraints and priorities  
- Ensure clarity before design and implementation

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential for several reasons:  

1. **Defines Project Scope**  
   Clearly identifies what the system will and will not do, preventing misunderstandings.  

2. **Prevents Scope Creep**  
   Helps control changes during development by establishing well-defined requirements upfront.  

3. **Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction**  
   Validates that the system meets user needs and expectations, reducing errors and rework.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The main activities in Requirement Analysis include:  

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting stakeholders’ needs and expectations through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and elaborating on gathered requirements using techniques like brainstorming and prototyping.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating detailed documents, including requirement specifications and use cases.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, and creating models to represent them.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing and validating requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment with goals.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should **do**. Examples for the booking management system:  
- Secure login and user authentication  
- Search and filter properties  
- Booking creation and cancellation  

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**. They ensure the system meets performance, usability, security, and reliability standards. Examples for the booking management system:  
- Page load time under 2 seconds  
- Data encryption for user information  
- System uptime of 99.9%

## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visualize the interactions between users (actors) and the system (use cases). They help stakeholders and developers understand functionality and system boundaries.  

**Benefits:**  
- Improves communication with stakeholders  
- Clarifies system functionality  
- Identifies actors and their interactions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure that the software delivers the intended functionality correctly.  

**Importance:**  
- Provides a clear definition of “done”  
- Ensures consistent quality and alignment with requirements  
- Helps testers verify feature implementation  

**Example (Checkout Feature):**  
- User can add items to the cart and proceed to checkout  
- Payment gateway processes transactions successfully  
- Booking confirmation is sent via email  
- Checkout process completes within 30 seconds
